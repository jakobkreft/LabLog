**LabLog** is a digital laboratory notebook designed for use in labs to replace traditional paper notebooks. It helps lab workers record and manage sensor data, observations, and procedures in an organized way, with automatic timestamping for each entry. LabLog supports both text and image-based data entry, and integrates with IoT sensors via MQTT to securely store data.

### Features
- **Automatic Timestamping**: Every entry is timestamped automatically.
- **Text and Image Support**: Log numeric and textual data, as well as attach images to entries.
- **IoT Integration**: Supports IoT sensor integration through the MQTT protocol.
- **Data Organization**: Entries are easily searchable and categorized for later retrieval.
